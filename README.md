## Description

<div align="left">The purpose of our tool is to analyze emotions from a large number of tweets, in two steps:</div>
<br>

<div align="left">Step1 : The user writes a query in the search bar, which can be a username, hashtag or subject. Our tool then fetches tweets related to the query.</div>
<div align="left">Step2 : Our program analyzes the fetched tweets and submits 4 results/charts :</div>
<br>

-	The first one is a WordCloud made of the words appearing the most frequently in the tweets fetched : the bigger the word is in the WordCloud the more it appeared in the results. The cloud will have the form of an emoji which should represent the main emotion emanating from the tweets.
-	The second one is a column chart representing the percentage of each emotion emanating from the tweets fetched. The higher bar should thus correspond to the emoji of the WorldCloud.
-	 The third one is made of four cursors giving further intel about the tweets : are they more positive or negative ? subjective or objective ? neutrous or famous ? unanimous or polarized ?
-	The fourth and last result displayed by the tool is a mosaic with no particular form made up of pictures which should represent the words frequently used within the tweets fetched.
